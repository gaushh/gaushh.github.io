Google Colaboratory or simply "colab" is a Jupyter-esque environment which provides a platform for writing and executing python code in browser. Colab notebook enviornment runs on cloud and the ipython notebooks are stored in google drive. The availablity of free GPU's and easy sharing is what really distinguishes any of its contemporaries.

## Starting with Google Colab
### Tip 1 : Connecting with Drive
Mount the drive to the collaboratory.
~~~
from google.colab import drive 
drive.mount('/content/drive')
~~~
This step lets the user read the files present in the mounted google drive and subsequenly write result files to the drive. After mounting, the drive home page can be treated as the root folder.
For example, to read file "news.txt" present in "News_Files" folder in the drive the following code can be used.
```
with open("/content/drive/My Drive/News_Files/news.txt", "rb") as infile:
  outfile.write(infile.read())
```

### Tip 2 : Using free GPU
To start using the free GPU:
> Menu bar --> Runtime --> Change Runtime Type --> GPU

It is important to keep in mind that Google provides limited use of free gpu service. So, use this option only when training and testing the models, not while writing code. 

**Pro Tip -** Some of the models I've trained took significantly longer than than the upper limit of the capacity. I tend to save the checkpoints in the drive regularly (in pytorch using 'torch.save') after a particular number of iterations. After the capacity of the google account I'm using gets drained, I download the ipython notebook and reupload it to another colab account in incognito. Finally, mount it on the original drive account in which saved model was stored and load the saved checkpoint file. This will resume the training process from the checkpoint. All in all, you can use the GPU provided by colab forever given you have access to sufficient number of google accounts. 

### Tip 3 : Installing libraries/modules in colab
All major libraries/modules like pytorch, tensorflow, fastai, opencv etc. are preinstalled in pytorch. If you wish to use a custom library which is not already there in colab or to use a different version of the preinstalled module, you can use !pip install or !apt-get install.

~~~
 !pip install -q matplotlib-venn 
 !pip install tensorflow==1.12.0 
~~~
"!" prompts the notebook cell to treat the code as a command line script.
