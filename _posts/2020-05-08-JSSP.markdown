# Job Shop Scheduling Problem GUI
## Introduction
- The design of optimal job schedules on parallel machines with finite time, plays a crucial role in manufacturing and production facilities
- Job shop scheduling requires the allocation of tasks to available resources while satisfying various time, supply and demand constraints
- Combinatorial optimization problem which utilizes binary variables when solved with mathematical programming techniques.
- Moderate increase in orders and machines scales the problem dimension exponentially
- Simple scheduling problem with 3 Jobs and 2 machines

- T type of raw materials, J processes, I different products.
- A product can be produced by more than one process.
- Processes can have different production capacity levels
- No production is possible from a process below the minimum capacity level or greater than the maximum capacity level
- Cost between capacity levels is a linear function of the quantity that is produced
